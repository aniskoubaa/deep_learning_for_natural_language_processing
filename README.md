| **Semester** | Spring 2025 |
| **Credits** | 3 |

## Course Description

This course covers the foundations and modern architectures of deep learning applied to natural language processing. Starting from how text is represented numerically (tokenization, embeddings, vectors), students progress through recurrent architectures (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs), the Transformer architecture (self-attention, encoder-decoder), and key NLP applications (machine translation, named entity recognition, retrieval-augmented generation).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Explain the role of tokenization in language models and compare character-level, word-level, and subword-level methods
2. Represent words as dense vectors using embedding techniques (Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText)
3. Understand and implement recurrent neural networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU) for sequence modeling
4. Master the Transformer architecture, including self-attention, multi-head attention, and positional encoding
5. Apply deep learning models to NLP tasks such as machine translation and named entity recognition
6. Understand retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and its role in modern AI systems
